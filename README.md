# A Welcomming Short Note

Hello everyone,\
my name is Thomas and I'm working as Mathematician(professor) and Artist(Musician).\
My new life addition and hopefully potentially career path is the wed-developing.

Since October 2022, I've started to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript.\
As an alumni of N.K.U.A  I know also Python, Java, MatLab, and Logo.

I've been participating in a public seminar(completed) for Front-End\
and in a private boot-camp of SHA Academy ,that is still ongoing.

A lot of things to say but I prefer to show you.\
I'll be really glad to hear your feedback.

See you on my next update or project!
