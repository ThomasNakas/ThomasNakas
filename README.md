# A Welcomming Short Note

Hello everyone,\
my name is Thomas and I'm working as Mathematician(professor) and Artist(Musician).\
The new addition in my life and hopefully my new (career) path is the wed-developing.

Since October 2022, I've started to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript.\
As an alumni of N.K.U.A  I know also Python, Java, MatLab, and Logo.

I've been participating in a public seminar(completed) for Front-End\
and in a private boot-camp of SHA Academy ,that is still ongoing.

See you on my next update or project!
