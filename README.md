# Greetings, GitHub community! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Thomas, a passionate problem-solver and creative thinker. As an alumnus of Athens University, I hold a degree in Mathematics and have spent over a decade teaching and developing my skills in pedagogy and logical thinking.

Alongside my academic career, I've gained valuable experience in human resource management, coordination, and adaptability in the hospitality industry for the past four years.

Driven by a long-standing fascination with software development, I recently made the decision to pursue a career in this field. My background in Mathematics and exposure to programming languages such as Java, Matlab, and R have equipped me with a keen sense of logic and an appreciation for interactive, instant-feedback systems.

I'm actively learning and working with various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, 3js by participating into a Social Hackers Academy's FrontEnd/Blockchain  Bootcamp. As for my interests, I'm drawn to software development, blockchain, interactive systems, and music production.

Since March 2024 I've started my journey as a 42 student in Heilbronn of Germany. Our curicullum is in C and C++
