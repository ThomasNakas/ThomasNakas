# Hello, GitHub community! 👋

My name is Thomas, and I'm thrilled to introduce myself to you. As a Mathematics alumnus from Athen's University, I've always had a passion for problem-solving and creativity. 

Over the past decade, I've been teaching Mathematics and developing my skills in pedagogy and logical thinking. Additionally, I've spent the last five years working in the hospitality industry, where I gained valuable experience in human resource management, coordination, and adaptability.

Recently, I made the decision to pursue a career in software development, which has been a long-standing fascination of mine. My background in Mathematics and exposure to programming languages such as Java, Matlab, and R have equipped me with a keen sense of logic and an appreciation for interactive, instant-feedback systems. 

To further my knowledge and skills, I've been actively learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, and 3js. I'm currently enrolled in the Social Hackers Academy Bootcamp for Front-End/Blockchain Development, which has been an incredible experience so far.

Overall, I'm excited about the prospect of joining the GitHub community and contributing to innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, and I look forward to collaborating with you all soon!
