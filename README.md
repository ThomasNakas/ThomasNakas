## Hello, GitHub community!

I am thrilled to introduce myself to this talented and innovative community. My name is Thomas, and I have a background in Mathematics and a passion for creativity and problem-solving. For the past 11 years, I have been teaching Mathematics, honing my pedagogical skills, and improving my critical thinking abilities. I have also spent the last five years working as a receptionist and minor manager at a social hostel, where I gained valuable experience in human resource management, coordination, and adaptability.

Recently, I made a career shift towards software development, which has been a long-standing fascination of mine. I am currently enrolled in the Social Hackers Academy Bootcamp for Front-End/Blockchain Development, where I am actively learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, and 3js. My background in Mathematics and exposure to programming languages such as Java, Matlab, and R have provided me with a keen sense of logic and an appreciation for interactive, instant-feedback systems.

As a creative problem-solver, I believe my diverse range of skills, including my musical and artistic background, make me an ideal candidate for your community. I am excited to contribute my skills and learn from other talented individuals. Thank you for taking the time to read about me. 

Best regards,  
Thomas
